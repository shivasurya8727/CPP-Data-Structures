# C++ Problem Solving

This repository contains C++ programs that I wrote while learning
data structures and algorithms, focusing on writing clean and
efficient solutions.

## Topics Covered
- Sorting
- Binary Search
- Binary Search on Answer
- Greedy Algorithms

Each file represents a single problem and reflects what I learned
about optimizing brute-force approaches into efficient solutions.
